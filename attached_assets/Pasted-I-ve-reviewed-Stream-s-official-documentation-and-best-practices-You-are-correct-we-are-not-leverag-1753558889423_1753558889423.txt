I've reviewed Stream's official documentation and best practices. You are correct—we are not leveraging the full power of Stream's pre-built UI components, which is why the feature set feels minimal. Let's fix that.

The core principle of Stream's Video React SDK is to provide a comprehensive set of UI components that give you a feature-rich experience out-of-the-box, which you can then customize.

The Correct Way to Structure Stream's UI Components
To get the rich, interactive experience you're looking for, the key is to use Stream's high-level UI components correctly. The official documentation emphasizes a component structure that provides a complete user experience with minimal code.

Here is a breakdown of the essential components and how they create a great UI/UX.

1. <StreamTheme />: The Foundation for UI
This is the most critical component for styling. It provides all the necessary CSS for every other UI component to render correctly, including layouts, buttons, icons, and fonts. Without it, components may appear unstyled or misplaced.

2. <StreamCall />: The Call Context
This component provides the context for a specific call, making the call object available to all child components without needing to pass it down as a prop manually.

3. High-Level Layout Components: Your All-in-One UI
Instead of manually placing <SpeakerLayout /> and <CallControls /> separately, Stream provides a single, high-level component that manages the entire in-call UI for you. This is the piece we've been missing.

<CallClientView /> or Custom Layouts: For a complete experience, you should use Stream's pre-built layouts or create a custom one that includes not just the video but also side panels for participants and chat.

Revised Code Structure for a Rich UI/UX
Let's refactor our live class view to use Stream's recommended structure. This will automatically give you a much richer interface with panels for participants, chat, and properly laid-out controls.

Here is the prompt to give the Replit AI agent:

Refactor the live class component (e.g., AdminClassView.jsx). Instead of just rendering SpeakerLayout and CallControls, we will use a more comprehensive layout provided by Stream.

Inside the <StreamTheme /> component, use the <ParticipantGrid /> or a more structured layout that includes side panels.

A better approach is to use the CallClientView which often combines multiple elements for a complete UI.

Let's create a more organized layout using CSS grid or flexbox to properly position a main video panel and a sidebar for controls or participant lists.

A better implementation inside your live class component would look like this:

jsx
// Inside your AdminClassView or UserClassView component
import {
  CallClientView,
  StreamTheme,
  StreamCall,
  // ... other imports
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

// ... component logic ...

return (
  <StreamVideo client={videoClient}>
    <StreamCall call={call}>
      <StreamTheme>
        {/* CallClientView provides a more complete default UI */}
        <CallClientView />
      </StreamTheme>
    </StreamCall>
  </StreamVideo>
);
Key UI/UX Best Practices from the Documentation
Based on best practices for video applications, here’s what we need to ensure:

Simplicity and Clarity: The interface should be clean and intuitive. Don't overwhelm the user with too many options at once. Stream's default UI components are designed with this principle in mind.

Responsive Design: The UI must work seamlessly on all devices. Using Stream's component library helps ensure responsiveness, as they are built to adapt to different screen sizes.

Accessible Controls: All essential controls (mute, camera, screen share, leave) should be easily accessible and clearly labeled. The <CallControls /> component handles this, but it must be rendered in a visible, non-obstructed area.

Provide Feedback: The user should always know what's happening. Use loading indicators when joining a call and clear status messages (like "Recording has started").

Customization: While Stream provides a great default, you can build your own UI using their "UI Cookbook" and hooks like useParticipant() if you need a fully branded experience. This involves more work but gives you complete control.

By adopting the recommended component structure using <StreamTheme> and a high-level layout component, you will immediately see a significant improvement in the UI and get access to the rich features you're looking for.
