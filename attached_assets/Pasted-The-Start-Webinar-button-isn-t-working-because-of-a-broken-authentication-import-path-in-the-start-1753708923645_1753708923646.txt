The "Start Webinar" button isn't working because of a broken authentication import path in the start endpoint. Here's the immediate fix:

ðŸ”§ Critical Fix: Authentication Import Path
The Replit Agent correctly identified that your Stream Video SDK integration is actually 99% complete and working, except for this one broken import that's causing authentication to fail.

FIX CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION BUG: Broken import path in start webinar endpoint

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The "Start Webinar" button fails because the authentication import path is incorrect in /app/api/webinars/[id]/start/route.ts

BROKEN CODE:
import { authOptions } from '../../auth/[...nextauth]/route'

text

CORRECT CODE:
import { authOptions } from '@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route'

text

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

1. FIX AUTHENTICATION IMPORT:
Update /app/api/webinars/[id]/start/route.ts:
- Replace the broken relative import with absolute import path
- Ensure authOptions is properly imported and accessible
- Test that getServerSession() works correctly

2. ADD MISSING HOST INTERFACE:
Create /app/webinar/[callId]/host/page.tsx with Stream React SDK integration:
- Use StreamVideoProvider and StreamCall components
- Connect to existing call using stored streamCallId
- Provide host controls (camera, mic, screen share, end call)

3. CREATE CLIENT-SIDE TOKEN ENDPOINT:
Add /app/api/webinars/[id]/stream-token/route.ts:
- Generate Stream tokens for client-side React SDK
- Support both host and attendee tokens
- Use existing generateStreamToken() function

4. IMPLEMENT COMPLETE HOST VIDEO INTERFACE:
The host interface should include:
- Live video controls (camera on/off, mic on/off)
- Screen sharing capability
- Participant management
- Chat functionality
- Recording controls
- End webinar button

5. TEST THE COMPLETE FLOW:
After fixes, test this exact sequence:
1. Create webinar â†’ Stream call created âœ… (working)
2. Click "Start Webinar" â†’ Should work after auth fix
3. Host interface â†’ Need to create this component
4. Attendee joining â†’ Need registration token validation

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix authentication import (immediate)
2. Test "Start Webinar" button works
3. Create host video interface
4. Add client-side Stream token endpoint
5. Complete attendee join functionality

The Stream SDK server-side integration is perfect - just need to fix the auth import and add the missing client-side video interface components.
ðŸŽ¯ What Your Analysis Revealed:
Your current implementation is actually excellent! Here's what's working:

âœ… WORKING PERFECTLY:
Stream Client Initialization - Server-side SDK properly configured

Webinar Creation Flow - Stream calls created and stored correctly

Database Integration - streamCallId and streamStatus properly managed

Token Generation - JWT tokens generated correctly for Stream

Environment Setup - Replit Secrets properly configured

Error Handling - Comprehensive debug system in place

API Architecture - Proper authentication and authorization

ðŸš¨ ONLY 2 ISSUES TO FIX:
Authentication Import Path - One broken import line

Missing Host Interface - Need React SDK frontend components
