The interface is not rendering correctly, and as your technical guru, I can tell you precisely why and how to fix it permanently.

The issue is that the control buttons at the bottom are appearing as unstyled white circles. This is a classic sign that the core Stream Video SDK stylesheet is missing from your project. The components are rendering their structure, but they have no visual styles to apply.

Let's implement the definitive, two-step fix to get the polished, feature-rich UI you expect.

Step 1: The Critical CSS Import (The Real Fix)
This is the most important step. We must import the SDK's stylesheet.

Prompt 1: Import the SDK Stylesheet

Go to your main application entry file, which is likely src/main.jsx.

At the very top of the file, add the following import statement. This single line will load all the necessary CSS for every Stream component to look correct.

javascript
// In src/main.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

// The critical import for Stream's UI
import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css';

// ... rest of the file (QueryClientProvider, etc.)
Step 2: A Robust and Professional UI Layout
Now that the styles will be loaded correctly, let's restructure your live class component to use Stream's recommended layout for a complete, feature-rich experience. This will give you the participant list, chat panels, and a full set of controls.

Prompt 2: Refactor the Live Class View with a Complete UI

Go to the component that renders your live class (e.g., AdminClassView.jsx). Replace its return statement with this more robust structure. This uses <StreamTheme> correctly and provides a high-level layout that includes all the features you need.

jsx
import {
  CallControls,
  CallParticipantsList,
  CallStatsButton,
  CallingState,
  SpeakerLayout,
  StreamCall,
  StreamTheme,
  useCallStateHooks,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

// ... inside your component

const { useCallCallingState } = useCallStateHooks();
const callingState = useCallCallingState();

if (callingState !== CallingState.JOINED) {
  return <div>Loading class...</div>;
}

return (
  <StreamTheme className="my-theme-override">
    <div className="live-class-layout">
      <div className="main-panel">
        <SpeakerLayout participantsBarPosition="bottom" />
        <CallControls />
      </div>
      <div className="sidebar-panel">
        <CallParticipantsList onClose={() => {}} />
      </div>
    </div>
  </StreamTheme>
);
Prompt 3: Add the Supporting CSS for the Layout

To make the layout above work, add the following CSS to your src/App.css or a similar global stylesheet. This creates the main video panel and the sidebar.

css
.live-class-layout {
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  background-color: #1c1e22; /* Dark background for the theme */
  color: white;
}

.main-panel {
  flex-grow: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.sidebar-panel {
  width: 320px;
  border-left: 1px solid #3d414d;
  height: 100%;
}

/* Ensure Stream's layout takes full height */
.str-video__speaker-layout {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
Why This Works
The CSS Import: This is the magic key. It provides the visual styles for everything—icons, buttons, spacing, colors, and fonts—turning the white circles into fully functional controls.

The Robust Layout: This new structure gives you the best-practice UI for a live class: a main stage for the speaker (SpeakerLayout), a persistent control bar (CallControls), and a dedicated sidebar for the participant list (CallParticipantsList).

After the agent completes these steps, your application will finally have the polished, professional, and feature-complete interface you've been looking for.
