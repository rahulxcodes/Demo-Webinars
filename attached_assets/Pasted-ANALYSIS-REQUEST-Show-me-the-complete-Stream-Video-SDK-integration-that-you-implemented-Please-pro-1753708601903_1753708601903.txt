ANALYSIS REQUEST: Show me the complete Stream Video SDK integration that you implemented

Please provide a comprehensive overview of how you integrated Stream Video SDK into our webinar platform. I need to understand the complete technical implementation to debug why the "Start Webinar" button isn't working.

SHOW ME THE COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE:

1. STREAM CLIENT INITIALIZATION:
   - How did you initialize the StreamVideoClient?
   - Where is it initialized (server-side vs client-side)?
   - What configuration options did you use?
   - Show me the exact code for client setup

2. WEBINAR CREATION FLOW:
   - What happens when a webinar is created?
   - Do you create a Stream call immediately during webinar creation?
   - How do you generate and store the streamCallId?
   - Show me the exact API endpoint code for webinar creation

3. START WEBINAR IMPLEMENTATION:
   - What does the "Start Webinar" button actually do?
   - Show me the frontend click handler code
   - What API endpoint does it call?
   - How does the /api/webinars/[id]/start endpoint work?
   - Do you use call.goLive() or a different method?

4. HOST INTERFACE INTEGRATION:
   - How does the host interface connect to Stream?
   - Do you use StreamVideoProvider and StreamCall components?
   - How do you join the existing call?
   - Show me the complete host interface code

5. AUTHENTICATION & TOKENS:
   - How do you generate Stream user tokens?
   - Where do you handle user authentication for Stream?
   - How do you pass user roles (host vs attendee) to Stream?

6. DATABASE INTEGRATION:
   - How is streamCallId stored in the database?
   - What's the complete database schema you're using?
   - How do you retrieve the streamCallId when starting a webinar?

7. ERROR HANDLING:
   - What error handling did you implement?
   - How do you handle Stream API failures?
   - What debugging/logging is in place?

8. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - How are Stream API keys configured in Replit?
   - Are they stored in Replit Secrets?
   - How does the app access these environment variables?

SPECIFIC FILES TO SHOW:
Please show me the complete code for these files:
- /lib/stream/client.ts (or wherever Stream client is initialized)
- /app/api/webinars/route.ts (webinar creation)
- /app/api/webinars/[id]/start/route.ts (start webinar endpoint)
- /app/webinar/[id]/host/page.tsx (host interface)
- /app/api/webinars/[id]/stream-token/route.ts (token generation)
- Any other Stream-related files you created

DEBUGGING INFORMATION:
Also tell me:
- Are there any console errors when clicking "Start Webinar"?
- What happens in the network tab when the button is clicked?
- Are the API endpoints actually being called?
- Are there any Stream-specific error messages?
- What's the current status of a webinar in the database vs Stream?

REPLIT-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION:
- How did you handle Replit's environment constraints?
- Did you use any Replit-specific features for the integration?
- Are there any Replit hosting limitations affecting Stream SDK?

Please provide the complete technical overview so I can understand exactly what was implemented and identify where the "Start Webinar" functionality is breaking down.
