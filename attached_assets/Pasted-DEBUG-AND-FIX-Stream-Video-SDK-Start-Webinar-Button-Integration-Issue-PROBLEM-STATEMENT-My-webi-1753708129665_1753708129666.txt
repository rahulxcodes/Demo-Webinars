DEBUG AND FIX: Stream Video SDK "Start Webinar" Button Integration Issue

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
My webinar platform has a "Start Webinar" button that should activate a pre-scheduled Stream Video call, but it's not working. I need you to analyze the current code and fix the integration following Replit's best practices for live streaming applications.

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE THAT SHOULD BE WORKING:
1. Webinar Creation → Creates Stream call with unique streamCallId and stores in database
2. Click "Start Webinar" → Should call /api/webinars/[id]/start endpoint
3. Start API → Should use streamClient.call().goLive() to activate existing call
4. Host Interface → Should connect to existing call using stored streamCallId

REPLIT-SPECIFIC DEBUGGING APPROACH:
Based on Replit's approach to video streaming apps, please check these areas:

1. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN REPLIT:
   - Verify STREAM_API_KEY and STREAM_SECRET are properly set in Replit Secrets
   - Check if environment variables are accessible at runtime
   - Add logging to confirm API keys are loaded correctly

2. NETWORK CONNECTIVITY:
   - Replit has specific network constraints for WebRTC and streaming
   - Check if Stream SDK can connect to external servers from Replit
   - Add connection testing for Stream API endpoints

3. STREAM CLIENT INITIALIZATION:
   - Verify StreamVideoClient is properly initialized server-side
   - Check if Stream call creation actually succeeds during webinar creation
   - Add comprehensive error logging for all Stream SDK operations

4. API ENDPOINT DEBUGGING:
   - Add detailed console.log statements to /api/webinars/[id]/start endpoint
   - Verify if the endpoint is actually being called when button is clicked
   - Check if streamCallId exists in database and is valid
   - Test if call.goLive() method works in Replit environment

5. FRONTEND-BACKEND CONNECTION:
   - Verify fetch request from frontend actually reaches the API
   - Check for CORS issues or request blocking
   - Add error handling and user feedback for failed requests

SPECIFIC REPLIT REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Use Replit's built-in logging system for debugging
2. Add a /debug/stream-status endpoint to test Stream connectivity
3. Implement Replit-compatible error handling and retry logic
4. Ensure all async operations work properly in Replit's environment
5. Add fallback mechanisms for network issues

DEBUGGING STEPS TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Create test endpoint: /api/debug/stream-test that tries to:
   - Initialize Stream client
   - Create a test call
   - Make the call go live
   - Return detailed success/failure information

2. Add comprehensive logging to webinar creation process:
   - Log when Stream call is created
   - Log the streamCallId being stored
   - Log any Stream API errors

3. Add detailed logging to start webinar process:
   - Log when start button is clicked
   - Log API request being sent
   - Log streamCallId being retrieved from database
   - Log Stream call.goLive() attempt and response

4. Create frontend error display:
   - Show loading states during start process
   - Display specific error messages when start fails
   - Add retry button for failed starts

EXPECTED FIXES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Fix Stream SDK initialization with proper Replit environment setup
2. Add proper error handling for all Stream operations
3. Implement network retry logic for Stream API calls
4. Add comprehensive debugging endpoints
5. Fix any CORS or network connectivity issues specific to Replit

TESTING APPROACH:
1. First test basic Stream connectivity from Replit
2. Test webinar creation → verify Stream call is actually created
3. Test start webinar API → verify it can find and activate the call
4. Test frontend integration → verify button click triggers correct API call
5. Add visual feedback for each step of the process

Please analyze the current implementation, identify exactly where the "Start Webinar" process is failing, and provide a complete fix that works reliably in Replit's environment with proper error handling and debugging capabilities.
Additional Follow-up Prompts for Replit Agent:
After running the main debug prompt, you can ask the Replit agent these specific questions:

1. Network Connectivity Test:
text
Create a simple test endpoint that verifies if Replit can connect to Stream Video SDK servers and make API calls
2. Environment Variables Check:
text
Add logging to verify that STREAM_API_KEY and STREAM_SECRET are properly loaded from Replit Secrets
3. Step-by-Step Debug:
text
Add console.log statements to every step of the start webinar process so we can see exactly where it fails
What This Approach Will Identify:
Based on Replit's patterns for video streaming applications, the most common issues are:

Environment Variable Access - Stream keys not properly configured in Replit Secrets

Network Limitations - Replit's hosting environment blocking certain WebRTC connections

API Initialization - Stream client not properly initialized server-side

Database Connection - streamCallId not being stored or retrieved correctly

Frontend-Backend Communication - Button click not properly triggering API calls

The debug prompt above follows Replit's recommended approach of:

Incremental debugging with detailed logging

Environment-specific testing for Replit constraints

Built-in error handling with proper user feedback

Network connectivity validation for external APIs
