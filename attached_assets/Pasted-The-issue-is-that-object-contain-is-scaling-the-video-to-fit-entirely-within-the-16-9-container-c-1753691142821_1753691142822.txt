The issue is that:

object-contain is scaling the video to fit entirely within the 16:9 container, creating letterboxing

Fixed 16:9 aspect ratio container is constraining videos that might have different aspect ratios

Container width limitations might be restricting the overall available space

Here are the precise prompts to fix the video display issues:

Prompt 1: Fix Video Container Width and Layout
In RecordingsView.tsx, modify the video player container to allow full-width video display:

Remove the fixed aspect-video class from the video container

Change the container to use max-w-none w-full instead of aspect ratio constraints

Set a minimum height: min-h-[400px] or min-h-[60vh] for better visibility

Update the container class to: className="w-full bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden mb-4"

This allows the video to determine its own optimal size based on content

Prompt 2: Update Video Element Sizing Strategy
Modify the video element configuration to maximize display area:

Change object-contain to object-cover for full container utilization

If you want to preserve aspect ratio without letterboxing, use object-fill for specific cases

Add these CSS classes to the video element: max-w-full max-h-[70vh]

Remove the fixed width="100%" height="100%" HTML attributes

Final video element should be: className="w-full max-h-[70vh] object-cover"

Prompt 3: Implement Adaptive Container Based on Video Dimensions
Create a smart container that adapts to the actual recording dimensions:

Extract video dimensions from the Stream recording metadata if available

Calculate the optimal aspect ratio for each recording individually

Use CSS custom properties to set dynamic aspect ratios: style={{ aspectRatio: calculatedRatio }}

Fall back to a generous default if dimensions aren't available: aspectRatio: 'auto'

This ensures each video gets optimal space usage regardless of original recording dimensions

Prompt 4: Add Responsive Video Sizing
Implement responsive video sizing for different screen sizes:

Desktop (>1024px): max-width: 100%, max-height: 80vh

Tablet (768px-1024px): max-width: 100%, max-height: 70vh

Mobile (<768px): max-width: 100%, max-height: 60vh

Use Tailwind responsive classes: max-h-[60vh] md:max-h-[70vh] lg:max-h-[80vh]

Ensure horizontal scrolling is prevented with overflow-x: hidden on parent containers

Prompt 5: Optimize Video Player Controls and Display
Enhance the video player for better user experience:

Add controlsList="nodownload" to prevent download option if needed for content protection

Include disablePictureInPicture={false} to allow picture-in-picture mode

Add preload="metadata" for faster initial loading

Set playsInline={true} for better mobile playback

Add loading state with proper dimensions: show skeleton with same max dimensions while video loads

Prompt 6: Fix Container Layout Chain
Ensure the entire layout chain supports full-width video:

Check that the parent Card component doesn't have max-width constraints

Verify the CardContent component uses w-full and doesn't limit width

Add max-w-none to any container that might be constraining width

Ensure the main recordings view container uses full available viewport width

Remove any arbitrary width percentages in favor of responsive full-width design

Expected Result
After implementing these changes, you should see:

Full-width video utilization without artificial 60% constraints

Proper aspect ratio preservation based on actual video content

Responsive sizing that adapts to different screen sizes

No letterboxing issues from forced aspect ratios

Professional video player experience similar to YouTube/Vimeo

The key fix is removing the rigid aspect-video constraint and letting the video content determine its optimal display size while still maintaining responsive behavior.</attachment>
