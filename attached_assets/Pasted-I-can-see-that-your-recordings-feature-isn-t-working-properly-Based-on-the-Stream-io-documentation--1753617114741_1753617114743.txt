I can see that your recordings feature isn't working properly. Based on the Stream.io documentation and our previous implementation, the issue is that we haven't properly implemented the recording playback functionality in your frontend.

The problem is that while Stream automatically handles recording creation during live calls, you need to implement the logic to fetch and display these recordings in your "Recordings" section.

Here's what needs to be fixed:

The Issue
Your current RecordingsView component is likely showing "0 Recordings" and "Unable to Load Recordings" because:

Missing Recording Configuration: The call type might not have recording enabled by default

Incomplete Recording Fetch Logic: The component isn't properly querying Stream's API for recordings

Missing Playback Implementation: There's no video player to actually display the recordings

The Solution
Here are the specific prompts to give the Replit AI agent to fix the recordings feature:

Prompt 1: Enable Recording on Call Type

Update your backend to ensure recording is enabled for your call type. In your server/index.js or auth service, add this configuration when creating or joining a call:

javascript
// When creating the call, enable recording
const call = videoClient.call('default', callId);
await call.update({
  settings_override: {
    recording: {
      mode: 'available',
      quality: '720p'
    }
  }
});
Prompt 2: Fix the RecordingsView Component

In src/components/RecordingsView.jsx, replace the existing logic with proper recording fetching:

jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function RecordingsView({ videoClient }) {
  const [recordings, setRecordings] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchRecordings = async () => {
      try {
        if (!videoClient) return;
        
        // Get the specific call we're using for live classes
        const call = videoClient.call('default', 'live-class-main-1');
        
        // Fetch recordings for this call
        const response = await call.listRecordings();
        setRecordings(response.recordings || []);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error fetching recordings:', err);
        setError('Failed to load recordings');
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchRecordings();
  }, [videoClient]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading recordings...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <div className="recordings-view">
      <h2>Class Recordings</h2>
      {recordings.length === 0 ? (
        <p>No recordings available yet. Record a live class to see recordings here.</p>
      ) : (
        <div className="recordings-list">
          {recordings.map((recording, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="recording-item">
              <h3>Class Recording {index + 1}</h3>
              <p>Recorded: {new Date(recording.start_time).toLocaleString()}</p>
              <p>Duration: {Math.round((new Date(recording.end_time) - new Date(recording.start_time)) / 60000)} minutes</p>
              <video 
                controls 
                width="100%" 
                height="400"
                src={recording.url}
              >
                Your browser doesn't support video playback.
              </video>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
Prompt 3: Add Recording Styles

Add these CSS styles to src/App.css for the recordings interface:

css
.recordings-view {
  padding: 2rem;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.recordings-list {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2rem;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}

.recording-item {
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}

.recording-item h3 {
  margin-top: 0;
  color: #333;
}

.recording-item video {
  margin-top: 1rem;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
How Recording Works with Stream
According to Stream's documentation, when you start recording during a live class:

Automatic Processing: Stream automatically processes the recording on their servers

Storage: Recordings are stored on AWS S3 (no additional cost)

Signed URLs: Recording URLs are signed and expire after 2 weeks for security

Events: Stream sends events when recording starts, stops, and is ready for playback
