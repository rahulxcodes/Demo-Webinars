DIAGNOSTIC REQUEST: Analyze duplicate participant issue in webinar

Please provide a comprehensive analysis of why the webinar is showing 3 participants that are all the same user (admin) instead of just 1 participant.

SHOW ME THE CURRENT STATE:

1. STREAM CLIENT INITIALIZATION:
   - Show me how the StreamVideoClient is initialized in the host interface
   - What user ID and user data is being passed to Stream?
   - Are we creating multiple Stream clients accidentally?

2. CALL JOINING LOGIC:
   - Show me the exact code where the host joins the Stream call
   - Are we calling call.join() multiple times?
   - Is the call being created and joined in multiple places?

3. USER IDENTIFICATION:
   - What user ID is being used for the Stream user object?
   - Show me the complete user object being passed to StreamVideoClient
   - Are we using session.user.id consistently?

4. TOKEN GENERATION:
   - Show me the /app/api/webinars/[id]/stream-token/route.ts endpoint
   - What user ID is being used to generate the Stream token?
   - Are multiple tokens being generated for the same user?

5. COMPONENT LIFECYCLE:
   - Are there multiple useEffect hooks calling initializeWebinar?
   - Is the component re-rendering and rejoining the call multiple times?
   - Show me the complete dependency array for the useEffect

6. STREAM CALL CREATION:
   - How many times is the Stream call being created?
   - Are we using call.join({ create: true }) or call.join({ create: false })?
   - Is the same streamCallId being used consistently?

7. BROWSER DEV TOOLS CHECK:
   - Check Network tab: How many requests to /stream-token endpoint?
   - Check Console: Are there multiple "joining call" or "user connected" messages?
   - Check Application tab: Are there multiple sessions or tokens stored?

8. DATABASE VERIFICATION:
   - What is the actual user ID in the database for this session?
   - Are there duplicate user records or sessions?

SPECIFIC DEBUGGING REQUESTS:
- Add console.log to show user ID being used for Stream client
- Add console.log to show how many times call.join() is called
- Add console.log to show the complete user object passed to Stream
- Check if there are multiple Stream clients being created

Please provide the exact code causing this duplication so I can identify whether it's:
- Multiple call joins
- Incorrect user identification  
- Component re-rendering issues
- Stream SDK configuration problems
