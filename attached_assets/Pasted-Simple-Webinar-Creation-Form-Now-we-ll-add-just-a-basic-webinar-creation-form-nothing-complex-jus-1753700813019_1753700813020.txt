Add a simple webinar creation system to the existing Next.js project:

CREATE WEBINAR FORM PAGE:
Create /app/dashboard/new-webinar/page.tsx with a basic form containing:

FORM FIELDS (keep it simple):
- Title (text input, required)
- Description (textarea, optional)
- Date (date picker)
- Time (time picker)
- Duration (dropdown: 30min, 60min, 90min, 120min)
- "Save Webinar" button

FORM HANDLING:
- Use react-hook-form for form management
- Basic client-side validation (title required, date in future)
- On submit: console.log the form data (we'll add API later)
- Show success message after form submission

UPDATE DASHBOARD:
Modify /app/dashboard/page.tsx:
- Make the "New Webinar" button link to /dashboard/new-webinar
- Add a simple webinars list (can be empty for now)
- Style it to look clean and professional

BASIC STYLING:
- Use Tailwind CSS for clean, modern styling
- Make forms responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Add basic hover effects and focus states
- Keep the design simple but professional

NAVIGATION:
- Add a simple header/navbar with:
  * "Webinar Platform" logo/title
  * "Dashboard" link
  * "New Webinar" link
- Add back button on new webinar page to return to dashboard

NO COMPLEX FEATURES YET:
- No database saving (just console.log for now)
- No recurring webinars
- No registration system
- No advanced settings
- Just a working form that collects basic webinar info

INSTALL ADDITIONAL PACKAGES IF NEEDED:
- react-hook-form
- @hookform/resolvers (if using validation)
- date-fns (for date handling)

Make sure the form works smoothly and looks good on both desktop and mobile.
What This Achieves:
âœ… Working webinar creation form
