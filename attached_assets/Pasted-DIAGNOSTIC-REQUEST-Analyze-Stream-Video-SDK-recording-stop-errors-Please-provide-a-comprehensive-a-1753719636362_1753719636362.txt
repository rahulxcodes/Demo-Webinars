DIAGNOSTIC REQUEST: Analyze Stream Video SDK recording stop errors

Please provide a comprehensive analysis of the recording stop errors occurring when ending the webinar.

ERROR DETAILS:
1. "[coordinator]: client:post - Error - url: /call/livestream/webinar-wesfsdf-1753719442053/stop_recording"
2. "StopRecording failed with error: call egress is not running"

SHOW ME THE CURRENT STATE:

1. WEBINAR END FUNCTION:
   - Show me the complete handleEndWebinar function at line 420 in /app/webinar/[id]/host/page.tsx
   - How are you calling call.stopRecording()?
   - What's the exact sequence of operations when ending the webinar?

2. RECORDING START LOGIC:
   - Show me where and how recording is started in the webinar
   - Are you calling call.startRecording() when the webinar begins?
   - Is there proper error handling for recording start failures?

3. STREAM CALL CONFIGURATION:
   - How is the Stream call configured for recording?
   - What recording settings are being used in call.update()?
   - Are you using the correct call type ('livestream' vs 'default')?

4. RECORDING STATUS CHECK:
   - Show me how you check if recording is actually running before stopping it
   - Are you using useIsCallRecordingInProgress() hook?
   - What does the recording status show in the UI?

5. CALL TYPE VERIFICATION:
   - What call type are you using? ('default', 'livestream', etc.)
   - Show me the exact call creation: streamClient.call(callType, callId)
   - Are you using the correct call type for recording features?

6. ERROR HANDLING:
   - How are recording errors currently being handled?
   - Are there any console logs showing recording start success/failure?
   - What happens if recording never started but you try to stop it?

7. STREAM SDK VERSION:
   - What version of @stream-io/video-react-sdk are you using?
   - Are you using the latest stable version?

SPECIFIC DEBUGGING REQUESTS:
- Add logging to show recording status before attempting to stop
- Add error handling for recording operations that gracefully handles "not running" state
- Check if recording actually started successfully when webinar began
- Verify the correct call type and configuration for recording features

Please show the exact code so I can identify whether this is:
- Recording never started properly
- Wrong call type for recording
- Missing recording configuration
- Improper error handling
