Database Integration & Dynamic Data
Now we'll connect your beautiful forms to the database so you can actually create, save, and display real webinars.

ðŸ¤– Replit AI Agent Prompt #4: Database Integration
text
Add full database integration to the webinar platform with proper API endpoints and data display:

DATABASE CONNECTION SETUP:
- Configure Prisma properly with PostgreSQL
- Add database connection utilities in /lib/db.ts
- Create proper error handling for database operations

API ENDPOINTS:
Create /app/api/webinars/route.ts:

POST endpoint (Create Webinar):
- Accept webinar data from the form
- Validate all required fields
- Save to database using Prisma
- Return success/error response with proper status codes
- Include proper TypeScript types

GET endpoint (List Webinars):
- Fetch all webinars from database
- Sort by creation date (newest first)
- Return webinars with proper formatting
- Add pagination support (limit 10 per page)

CREATE INDIVIDUAL WEBINAR API:
Create /app/api/webinars/[id]/route.ts:
- GET: Fetch single webinar by ID
- PATCH: Update webinar details
- DELETE: Delete webinar with confirmation

UPDATE WEBINAR CREATION FORM:
Modify /app/dashboard/new-webinar/page.tsx:

Form Submission:
- Replace console.log with actual API call to POST /api/webinars
- Add proper loading state during submission
- Show success message and redirect to dashboard
- Display error messages if submission fails
- Form validation before API call

Form Enhancement:
- Add form reset after successful submission
- Prevent double submission with loading state
- Client-side validation with proper error display

UPDATE DASHBOARD TO SHOW REAL DATA:
Modify /app/dashboard/page.tsx:

Data Fetching:
- Fetch real webinars from GET /api/webinars
- Use React state to manage webinars list
- Add loading skeleton while data loads
- Handle empty state when no webinars exist

Dynamic Stats Cards:
- Calculate real statistics from webinar data
- Total webinars count
- Upcoming webinars (future dates)
- Past webinars (completed)
- Show actual numbers instead of placeholders

Webinar Display:
- Show webinars in a beautiful card/table layout
- Display: Title, Date/Time, Status, Duration
- Add quick action buttons: Edit, Duplicate, Delete
- Color-code by status (upcoming = blue, past = gray, live = green)

WEBINAR STATUS LOGIC:
Add automatic status calculation:
- "upcoming" - start time is in the future
- "live" - currently between start time and end time
- "ended" - past the end time
- Update status dynamically based on current time

FORM ENHANCEMENTS:
Add these improvements to the webinar form:
- Time zone selection (default to user's timezone)
- Duration calculation (show end time automatically)
- Form auto-save as draft (optional)
- Better date/time validation (no past dates)

REAL-TIME UPDATES:
- Auto-refresh dashboard data periodically
- Update webinar status in real-time
- Show live indicator for ongoing webinars

ERROR HANDLING:
- Proper error boundaries for React components
- Database connection error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

DATA VALIDATION:
Create proper TypeScript types in /lib/types.ts:
export interface Webinar {
id: string;
title: string;
description?: string;
startTime: Date;
duration: number;
status: 'upcoming' | 'live' | 'ended' | 'cancelled';
hostId: string;
createdAt: Date;
updatedAt: Date;
}

export interface CreateWebinarRequest {
title: string;
description?: string;
startTime: string;
duration: number;
}

LOADING STATES:
- Skeleton loading for webinar cards
- Button loading spinners during form submission
- Page-level loading indicators
- Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states

Make sure everything works smoothly with proper error handling, loading states, and a great user experience when creating and viewing webinars.
