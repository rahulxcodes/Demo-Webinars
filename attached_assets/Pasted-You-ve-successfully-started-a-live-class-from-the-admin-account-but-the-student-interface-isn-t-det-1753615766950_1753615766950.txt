You've successfully started a live class from the admin account, but the student interface isn't detecting that a live class is in progress. This is a critical user experience problem where the real-time status detection between admin and student accounts isn't working properly.

The core issue is that your current implementation likely doesn't have a robust mechanism for students to detect when an admin has started a live class. Here's how to fix this:

The Problem
Your student view probably checks for an active call only once when the component loads, but it doesn't continuously monitor for when an admin starts a class. We need to implement real-time status detection.

The Solution: Real-Time Call Status Detection
Here are the prompts to give the Replit AI agent to implement proper live class detection:

Prompt 1: Create a Call Status Hook

Create a new custom hook in src/hooks/useCallStatus.js that continuously checks if a specific call is live. This hook should:

Use setInterval to query the Stream API every 5 seconds using videoClient.queryCalls()

Check if the call with ID live-class-main-1 has active participants

Return an object with isLive boolean and participantCount number

Clean up the interval when the component unmounts

Prompt 2: Update the Student Class View

In UserClassView.jsx, replace the current status checking logic with the new hook:

jsx
import { useCallStatus } from '../hooks/useCallStatus';

const { isLive, participantCount } = useCallStatus('live-class-main-1');

// Update the conditional rendering:
if (!isLive) {
  return (
    <div className="waiting-message">
      <h2>Class Status</h2>
      <p>The live class has not started yet.</p>
      <p>Please wait for your instructor to begin the session.</p>
      <button onClick={() => window.location.reload()}>
        Refresh Status
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

return (
  <div className="join-class-prompt">
    <h2>ðŸ”´ Live Class in Progress</h2>
    <p>Your instructor has started the class with {participantCount} participants.</p>
    <button 
      className="join-button"
      onClick={handleJoinClass}
    >
      Join Live Class
    </button>
  </div>
);
Prompt 3: Add Visual Styling for Class Status

Add these styles to your src/App.css to make the status messages clear and engaging:

css
.waiting-message {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 2rem;
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  border-radius: 8px;
  margin: 2rem;
}

.join-class-prompt {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 2rem;
  background-color: #d4edda;
  border: 1px solid #c3e6cb;
  border-radius: 8px;
  margin: 2rem;
}

.join-button {
  background-color: #28a745;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  font-size: 16px;
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-top: 1rem;
}

.join-button:hover {
  background-color: #218838;
}
How This Works
Continuous Monitoring: The custom hook polls Stream's API every 5 seconds to check if the specific call (live-class-main-1) has active participants

Real-Time Updates: When the admin starts a class, students will automatically see the status change within 5 seconds

Clear UI States: Students see different messages based on whether a class is live or not

Easy Joining: When a class is detected as live, students get a prominent "Join Live Class" button
